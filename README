Cigar.js

Use Cigar to import JavaScript dependencies in your .js files. 

Example Usage:
_import("path.to.js.fileName");

this will import /path/to/js/fileName.js by adding the script tag to the head.

Other config options:
_import("path.to.js.fileName", {async: "true", cacheBust: "203949"});

this will import /path/to/js/fileName.js?203949 with the async attribute set. 


You can also chain dependencies:
//Hat tip to @jeffremer for the idea on this one.

_import("some.path.fileName").
_import("another.path.fileName").
_import("i.need.those.other.two").
complete(function() {
    //called when all are loaded
});

You can see an very simple example here:

-The ability to change the main "class path"
-The ability to change the load timeout time.
